# ABCD Study Data Cleaning (R)

**Author:** Amanpreet Bhogal  

This repository contains an R script developed to clean and prepare data from the **Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study** for use in our lab’s analyses. The dataset required extensive preprocessing—such as handling missing values, renaming variables, and organizing behavioral and demographic measures—before it could be analyzed.

At the time of creating this script, I had **no prior coding experience**. I used a **large language model (LLM)** to help me write, understand, and debug the R code while learning the fundamentals of data manipulation. This project was my **first introduction to programming**, and it laid the foundation for my later work in Python, GIS, and health data analytics.
